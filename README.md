# Inferno - Violence
## What is it?
This is my culminating project for my AP Lit class, over Dante's Inferno--specifically the violence layer. In this, you play as a sinner already within the first part of the layer, with your goal being to escape through any means necessary. 

## Gameplay
This is a short rpg-style game with levels, and equipment. You have 4 basic stats--health, defense, damage, and mana.
